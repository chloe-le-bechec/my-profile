		<h2>About me ðŸ‘€</h2>
		<p>Hi there, nice to meet you! My name is <b>ChloÃ© Le Bechec</b> and I am a 21 year-old French girl.
			<br>I am currently doing my Master Program at IESEG School of Management, in Lille!
			<br>
			<br>
			I've always been<b>curious about the world</b> around me. The two main passions that are driving my life are food and travels. I love discovering and learning new things, and especially <b>getting out of my comfort zone</b> as much as I can!

		<h2>My personal food Instagram âš¡</h2>
		<p>One thing you have to know about me is that I am the owner of a<b>food Instagram account</b> named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eatlille/" target="_blank">@eatlille</a>. I started it about 2 years ago, when I had the idea to share my favorite spots around my city, to my friends and family.
			<br>
			<br>
			Since then, my community has grown and I continue to share my best places to eat in Lille to more than <b>4000 followers</b>!
